# Getting Started with Car Gallery

# LIVE HERE : https://car-gallery-threejs.web.app

Car-gallery is a 3D car showroom scene with three js and react with a configuration of controls from Leva, orbit controls and stats.
Technical stack : React JS / TypeScript / Three JS / fiber / drei / Leva / JEST - RTL / CRA / CSS / ESLint.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All screen size are handled, working in all browsers.

For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.

## How to run

### Install Node.js plateform

( Choose the LTS version recommanded for most users )

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --global yarn`

to install the yarn package, it's an alternative of npm.

### `yarn install`

To install all dependencies.

### `extract the scene.rar`

Extract the scene.rar file in public/models ( I couldn't upload it without compression because the limit of a file in free github version is 100 Mb ).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
