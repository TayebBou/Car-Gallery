# Getting Started with Car Gallery

# LIVE HERE : (https://car-gallery.web.app/)

Car-gallery is a 3D car showroom scene with three js and react with a configuration of controls from Leva, orbit controls and stats.
Technical stack : React JS / TypeScript / Three JS / fiber / drei / Leva / JEST - RTL / CRA / CSS / ESLint.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All screen size are handled, working in all browsers.

For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
